'''
Policy gradient

Each training iteration starts by running the policy for n_games_per_update (with maximum n_max_steps
per episode, to avoide running forever). At each step, we also compute the gradients. After n_games_per_update
have been run, we compute the action socres using the discount_and_normalize_rewards() function; we go through each
trainable variable, across all episodes and all steps, to multiply each gradient vector by its corresponding
action score; and we compute the mean of the resulting gradients. Finally, we run the training operation,
feeding it these mean gradients (one per trainable variable. We also save the model every save_iterations times.
